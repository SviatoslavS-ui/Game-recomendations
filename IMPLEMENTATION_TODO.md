## Notes and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Thymeleaf vs. REST API + SPA**: Chosen Thymeleaf for simpler deployment and better SEO
- **Custom CSS vs. Framework**: Custom CSS for precise control over Docker-inspired design
- **Server-side rendering**: Better for initial load performance and search engine optimization

### Future Enhancements
- Consider migrating to REST API + React/Vue for more complex interactions
- Implement real-time features with WebSocket
- Add machine learning recommendations
- Integrate with external gaming APIs
- Refactor genre handling to use Genre enum throughout the application
  - Update Game model to use Set<Genre> instead of Set<String>
  - Modify frontend to properly handle enum values
  - Update controllers and services for type safety
  - Migrate existing string-based genre data to enum values

- Refactor tags handling to use Tags enum throughout the application
  - Update Game model to use Set<Tags> instead of Set<String>
  - Modify frontend to properly handle enum values
  - Update controllers and services for type safety
  - Migrate existing string-based tag data to enum values

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with MVP features and iterate
- Test early and often across devices
- Plan for scalability from the beginning
- Document decisions and architectural choices
