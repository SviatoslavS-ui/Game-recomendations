        <div class="game-description">
            <p>Set in the post-apocalyptic ruins of Washington D.C. in the year 2277, Fallout 3 revolutionized the series by transitioning from isometric turn-based gameplay to an immersive first/third-person perspective with real-time combat. You play as the Lone Wanderer, who emerges from the shelter of Vault 101 in search of their father, only to become entangled in a struggle that will determine the fate of the Capital Wasteland.</p>
            <p>In this retro-futuristic world devastated by nuclear war, players must navigate the dangerous ruins of the capital, interact with various factions, and make moral choices that will impact the wasteland's future. The game seamlessly blends elements of action, RPG, and survival genres while maintaining the series' signature dark humor and retrofuturistic aesthetic.</p>
