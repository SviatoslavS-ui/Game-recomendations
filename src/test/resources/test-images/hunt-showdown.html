        <h1>Hunt: Showdown</h1>
        <div class="game-description">
            <p>Hunt: Showdown is a competitive first-person PvP bounty hunting game with heavy PvE elements. Set in the darkest corners of the world in 1896, you'll track terrifying monsters, deal with competing hunters, and risk everything as you compete to claim your bounty and escape alive.</p>
            <p>Every match combines the thrill of survival games with match-based gameplay in a uniquely tense experience. At the beginning of each match, up to 12 players, playing solo or in teams, must use their wits and arsenal to track monstrous targets, defeat them, and claim the bounty before other hunters beat them to it—all while avoiding becoming prey themselves.</p>
