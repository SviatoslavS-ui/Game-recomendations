        <div class="game-description">
            <p>In the quarantined city of Harran, you play as Kyle Crane, an undercover operative sent to infiltrate the area following a mysterious viral outbreak. By day, you scavenge for supplies in this vast urban environment overrun by the infected. By night, the hunters become the hunted as the infected transform into something far more dangerous.</p>
            <p>Combining first-person action, parkour movement, and survival horror elements, Dying Light challenges you to use your wits, agility, and improvised weapons to survive in a city where every decision could be your last. As you navigate the moral complexities of your mission, you must decide whether to follow orders or help the remaining survivors.</p>
