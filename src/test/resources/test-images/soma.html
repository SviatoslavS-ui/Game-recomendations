        <div class="game-description">
            <p>SOMA is a sci-fi horror game from Frictional Games, the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It is set beneath the ocean's surface at the remote underwater facility PATHOS-II.</p>
            <p>The game explores profound questions about consciousness, identity, and what it means to be human in a world where consciousness can be digitized. As machines start to take on human traits and humans become more machine-like, the line between human and machine begins to blur.</p>
