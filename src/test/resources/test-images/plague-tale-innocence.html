        <div class="game-description">
            <p>Follow the grim tale of young Amicia and her little brother Hugo in a heartrending journey through the
                darkest hours of history. Hunted by Inquisition soldiers and surrounded by unstoppable swarms of rats,

                unforgiving world.</p>
            <p>Set in 14th century France during the time of the Black Death, this emotional adventure combines stealth,
                puzzle-solving, and resource management as you guide these siblings through a nightmarish vision of
                history, where innocence is confronted by the harsh realities of a world consumed by plague and war.</p>
